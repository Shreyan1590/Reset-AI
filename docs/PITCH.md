# RESET AI – Pitch Deck Content

## 🚀 Elevator Pitch
*"RESET AI is your cognitive co-pilot that detects when you lose focus and instantly brings you back to where you left off."*

---

## The Problem (30 seconds)

**Context switching is destroying productivity.**

- Average knowledge worker switches tasks every **3 minutes**
- Takes **23 minutes** to regain full focus after interruption
- **2.1 hours** per day lost to context switching
- Results in mental fatigue, errors, and burnout

**The hidden cost:** Lost time trying to remember "what was I doing?"

---

## The Solution: RESET AI

An intelligent system that:
1. **Detects** when you lose context (tab switches, idle time, confusion)
2. **Captures** your work state automatically (pages, documents, code)
3. **Generates** AI summaries of what you were doing
4. **Restores** your thinking state with one click

**Think of it as "Undo" for your brain.**

---

## How It Works

```
Monitor → Detect → Capture → Recover
```

1. **Lightweight tracking** of browser activity
2. **ML-powered detection** of context loss moments
3. **Automatic snapshots** of your work context
4. **AI-generated** recovery prompts when you return

## Market Opportunity

- **Productivity tools market:** $102B by 2027
- **Growing remote work:** 58% work from home weekly
- **Focus apps trending:** Notion, Roam, Obsidian
- **Unmet need:** No solution for context recovery

---

## Business Model

### Freemium
- **Free:** 10 context captures/day, 7-day history
- **Pro ($9/mo):** Unlimited captures, full history, advanced AI
- **Team ($29/user/mo):** Team insights, shared contexts

### B2B
- **Enterprise:** Custom deployment, SSO, admin controls

---

## Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Gap |
|------------|-----|
| Tab managers | Don't capture context |
| Note apps | Require manual input |
| Time trackers | Don't help recovery |
| Focus apps | Block, don't restore |

**RESET AI fills the gap: Automatic context capture + AI recovery**
